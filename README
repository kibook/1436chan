    Bash and core utils


INSTALLING/UPGRADING
_____________________________________________________________________

    1. Extract chan.tar.gz to the folder that will be the root of
   your chan

    2. Run sh setup.sh


SETUP OPTIONS
_____________________________________________________________________

    Running sh setup.sh will prompt you for several options,
    which are stored in params.sh. This section outlines what
    each of these options means:

    CHAN_ROOT
        This is the root selector of your board.

    MAX_THREADS
        The maximum number of threads allowed on the board. When
        MAX_THREADS threads already exist and a user creates a
        new thread, the oldest thread (in terms of last updated)
        is either archived or deleted (see CHAN_ARCHIVE below).

    MAX_TITLELEN
        The maximum characters allowed in a thread
        title. Additional characters are truncated.

    MAX_POSTLEN
        The maximum characters allowed in a post. Additional
        characters are truncated.

    CHAN_ARCHIVE
        The folder where archived threads are stored. If blank,
        old threads are deleted instead of archived.

    DATE_FORMAT
        The format for displaying the date on posts and threads.

    SHOW_EMPTY_THREADS
        Either 'y' or 'n'. If 'y', then threads with 0 posts
        are shown on the main menu of the board. Otherwise, such
        empty threads are hidden until they have at least 1 post,
        requiring thread creators to supply an opening post (OP)
        after creating their thread.

    LAST_POSTS
        Up to LAST_POSTS posts are shown under each thread on
        the main menu.

    MAX_UPLOAD
        Maximum size of an upload in bytes. If this is > 0 then users
        are allowed to reply with 'uploaded' files. The users must
        actually provide a URL to a file which the server downloads
        to the respective thread directory and then posts a link
        to it in said thread.

	If this is 0, then uploads are disabled.

	[WARNING]: This means your server may connect to and download
	from other arbitrary servers. If you are concerned about
	what connections you make or what kinds of files you are
	storing on your server, disable this!


DELETING A THREAD OR POST
_____________________________________________________________________

    Deleting a thread or post is as simple as using rm.

    To delete a thread (from the root folder):

        rm -r <thread>

    where <thread> is the id number of the thread (Unix timestamp
    when it was created).

    To delete a post (from the root folder):

        rm <thread>/<post>

  where <post> is the id number of the post.


MESSAGE OF THE DAY
_____________________________________________________________________

    Create or edit the 'motd' file to add a message of the day
    to the top of the board.

    Lines in the motd file without TAB characters are turned in
    to inline text (type i), e.g. the line:
        Hello world!
    will become:
        iHello world!<TAB>fake<TAB>(NULL)<TAB>0<CR><LF>
    
    Otherwise they are interpreted as Gopher links, e.g.:
        IA picture<TAB>/pic<TAB>host<TAB>port


STICKIES
_____________________________________________________________________

    Stickies appear at the top of the board (in order of last
    update) marked by the prefix [sticky]. Unlike threads stickies
    will never be deleted or archived unless done so manually by
    an administrator. The administrator can create new stickies or
    turn existing threads in to stickies using the scripts below:

  sh newsticky.sh <title>
      Creates a new open sticky titled <title>. Open stickies
      can still be replied to by anyone.

  sh newrosticky.sh <title>
      Creates a new read-only (closed) sticky titled
      <title>. Closed stickies can only be replied to by an
      administrator.

  sh makesticky.sh <thread>
      Turns an existing thread in to an open sticky.

  sh makerosticky.sh <thread>
      Turns an existing thread in to a closed sticky.

  rm -r sticky_<...>
      Deletes the sticky with id <...>.

  sh post.sh sticky_<...>
      Add a post to the sticky with id <...>.


MULTIPLE BOARDS
_____________________________________________________________________

  There is no built-in feature for this, but if you wish to have
  multiple boards (representing certain subjects for discussion
  perhaps) you may simply create a parent directory for the overall
  "chan" and then perform the INSTALLING/UPGRADING procedure in
  multiple subdirectories, one for each board. Finally, create
  your own gophermap in the parent directory to customise the
  list of boards.
